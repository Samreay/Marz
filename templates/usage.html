        <h4>The program's purpose</h4>
        <p>This program is designed to take files from the AAOmega spectrograph after data reduction and allow redshifting of the spectra within.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4>30 second rundown</h4>
        <p>Take a <code>fits</code> file, drag it into the drop area to the left, wait for the program to automatically analyse all files.</p>
        <p>Double click the first spectra, if the automatic redshift is correct just assign a quality and move on. If not, find a feature, click on it, and then select which emission to mark it as. Once happy, select a quality and move on.</p>
        <p>When all spectra are done, hit the download button on the bottom right. Don't worry if you accidentally close the browser, results get saved internally automatically. Just reopen the browser, drag in the same file, and your results will appear instantly.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Problems or feature requests</h4>
        <p>If any bugs are found with the program, or there are features which could be added or improved to make life easier, please either raise an issue on the official Github issue page or send an email to me (the developer).</p>

    <accordion-group heading="Loading Files">
        <h4>Loading Files</h4>
        <p>Files can be loaded into the system by dragging them over the top left hand dashed box. The application will accept <code>.fits</code> files from the AAOmega spectrograph containing spectra, and <code>.csv</code> files containing saved results.</p>

        <p>To start from scratch, simply drag in a fits file and let the application start analysis. If you have previously been analysing the file and saved results, you can load these results back in by dragging in the previously download results file. The order of drag and drop does matter - please drop the results file first. Note that if you want to analyse a different fits file or stop using results, you must refresh the page (to be updated in the future).</p>
        <p>For quick usage, a few example FITS files from OzDES are provided, both having a results file you can also load into Marz:</p>
        <ul>

        <h4>Background Tasks</h4>
        <p>At the moment, the application processes spectra in two ways. Firstly, it iterates through all spectra and processes the raw data, providing smoothing, removal of cosmic rays, continuum subtraction and normalisation. It then goes back over the processed spectra and analyses them to find the best fitting template at a specific redshift. Whether or not the processing and analysing are done in the same instance or one after the other will become a configurable item.</p>
        <p>The state of the current background iteration is shown in the progress bar at the bottom of the screen. A green bar, matching the green plots, represents the progress through processing the spectra. The progress of the red bar (which comes after the green has finished) and matches the colour of the templates, represents the progress through analysing the spectra. The bar will turn blue when all spectra have been assigned a redshift.</p>

    <accordion-group heading="Merging Files">
        <h4>Merging Files</h4>
        <p>If you have had two people redshift the same <code>.fits</code> file and want to merge their results together, this can also be done from within Marz.</p>
        <p>Simply select the <code>.fits</code> file and the two <code>.mz</code> files, together, and drag them all into the drop zone in one go. Marz will recognise this as starting a merge, and proceed from there.</p>
        <p>On the overview screen Marz will now display not just the standard spectrum and template match, but also the two redshifted results offset above and below the template. Results which are flagged as needing to be manually merged (disagreeing redshifts) will have their QOP set to 0. Spectra that can be automatically merged will be done so, by choosing the redshift of the result with the highest QOP. If the QOPs are the same, the value of the default merger will be chosen. You can change the default merger in the sidebar. By default, the Overview screen will be set to only show QOP0 results, so that you can focus on the disagreements. The detailed screen will allow you to toggle between the two flagged redshifts either by pressing the relevant buttons or by pressing <code>q</code>. Simply pick a redshift and assign a quality flag as per normal redshifting to move onto the next disagreement. The results for both original <code>.mz</code> files will be appended to the spectrum's comment.</p>
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="The Overview Screen">
        <p>The overview screen allows a high level overview of all spectra to be quickly given to the user. Subsets of spectra can be displayed by using the filter options on the left sidebar, where options have been created for object types, templates, redshifts and quality flag (QOP).</p>
        <p>Users can also switch between a graphical overview, and a more compact table view, which allows sorting of the spectra based on ID, template, redshift or QOP.</p>
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="The Detailed Screen">
        <p>The detailed view allows users take processed spectra and manually redshift them. This can be accomplished in two main ways, matching templates or finding spectral lines.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Viewing the data</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Data toggle:</b> By default, the user is shown the processed data in green. This can be toggled back to the raw data (shown in black), by pressing the "Data" toggle in the upper menu.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Template toggle:</b> The best fitting template is automatically shown in red. You can hide the template using the template toggle in the upper menu. Use the "Offset" slider to move the template vertically, and the "Redshift" slider to move it horizontally. For all sliders, numerical values can also be entered instead.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Continuum toggle:</b>  The broad shape of the continuum can be turned off using the continuum toggle if you want to focus only on emission and absorption lines.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Variance toggle:</b>  The variance can be turned on to give you an indication of the uncertainty in the spectrum as a function of wavelength. The variance is displayed clipped to 3 standard deviations away from the mean, so that any large spike in variance do not wash out all the other features.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Smooth:</b>  The significant lines in the spectra can sometimes be more easily seen when the spectra has been smoothed slightly. The smooth toggle defaults to 3 pixel smoothing, but this can be altered on the slider in the top right.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Callout windows:</b> Zoom ins of the most interesting regions are shown in the small panels at the bottom of the screen.  This is helpful for finding precise line positions and checking the regions where the most significant lines usually appear.  You can also zoom in on the main screen by using your mouse to highlight the region you want to zoom on (make sure it stays within the bounds of the plot as you're highlighting). Zoom out again using the demagnifying symbol on the top right of the plot.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Cross correlation spectrum:</b>   The automatic redshifting provides a cross-correlation result shown in black above them main spectrum screen.  The peaks (and troughs) of this XCor result are the redshifts that the automatic fitting found most likely.  Clicking on this spectrum will move the template to that redshift and show you the value of the cross correlation (higher values are better).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h4>Redshifting the data</h4>
        There are multiple ways of finding redshifts for spectra in Marz.

        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Top Automatic Results: </b> The automatic matching algorithm in Marz returns the top five results, where the top result is shown by default. If this is not a correct redshift, you can view the other potential matches by pressing the buttons in the "Top Results" group in the upper menu bar, or by pressing <code>o</code> (which stands for "other").</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Matching templates: </b> The type of object you're looking at and its approximate redshift can be determined by comparing the observed spectrum (green) to the available template spectra (red).  All available templates can be viewed in the "Templates" tab, and the template that appears in the Detailed Screen can be changed using the menu bar at the top.</p>
            <li><p><b>Marking spectral lines: </b> If obvious emission or absorption lines can be seen in the spectra, you can assign them to specific element transitions. This can be done via clicking on the graph at the point of interest, and then selecting a spectral line in the upper toolbar, or pressing the appropriate keyboard shortcut (listed on this page under the "Keybindings" section below). This will update the redshift of the template. An alternate way that I prefer to use, is to select a point on the graph, and then repeatedly press <code>.</code> (or <code>,</code>) - this will cycle through all available spectral lines without having to remember multiple shortcuts.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Using cross-correlation: </b> Clicking on peaks in the cross-correlation plot will set the redshift to where you clicked. Strong cross correlation values (varies for templates, but generally above 8) can be investigated to check if they find the correct redshift.</p></li>
        </ul>


        <p>After setting a manual redshift, either via marking spectral features, selecting a point on the cross-correlation plot or manually entering a redshift, it is often desirable to perform a local fit to the data. Simply make sure you have the right template selected, and press the "Perform fit" button, or press <code>u</code>. This will fit the current spectrum and template within a small redshift window around the current redshift value.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Saving the redshift and assigning its quality</h4>
        <p>Results can be saved via pressing any one of the coloured buttons in the left sidebar under "Save QOP". A spectra that has only gone through the manual processing will have a QOP of 0 by default, unless you have turned on "Assign AutoQOPs" in the settings. An automatic QOP is suggested in the top menu bar based on the best automatic result, and you can accept this redshift and QOP by pressing <code>Enter</code>. A QOP can be chosen by either pressing the relevant button, by pressing the numeric key corresponding to the desired QOP.</p>
        <p>Whilst the meaning of the QOP values can change depending on survey, a good starting point as QOP 4 as very confident redshift (99% confidence), QOP3 as a good redshift (90% confidence), QOP2 as an uncertain redshift (50% confidence) and QOP 1 is for spectra that cannot be assigned any form of redshift. QOP6 is used for stars, where generally a QOP 4 or QOP 3 match to a stellar template would be given a QOP 6. Spectra flagged as QOP 2 and QOP 1 are not used for scientific purposes.</p>

        <h4>Downloading results</h4>
        <p>At any point during the redshifting process, you can download a file containing the spectra that have already been assigned redshifts, by pressing on the download button on the bottom right corner of the screen.</p>
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="The Templates Screen">
        <p>The templates screen for now only provides a simple graphical view of all the templates used by the application to match spectra.</p>
        <p>Unlikely templates can also be disabled by setting them to inactive. Inactive templates are not available in the detailed screen, nor do they undergo automatic matching. Making a template active or inactive applies instantly, but not retroactively.</p>
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="The Settings Screen">
        <p>The settings screen allows configuration of the program. All changes on the Settings screen are <strong>instantly</strong> applied on change, and do not need to be saved. The settings are stored as cookie values, and will persist between sessions.</p>
        <p>The options to clear the internal saved data are irreversible. If you have saved <code>.mz</code> output via downloading the results, these can still be loaded in without hassle, this section only pertains to the automatic background saving of results.</p>
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="Keybindings">
        <p>Many key bindings have been added to this application from the RUNZ default keymapping to make usage easier. Note that the way the key bindings and browser interact, make sure you don't have any input element selected when pressing the keyboard shortcuts. In most cases this is obvious - if you are in the comment text input, typing will write out a comment, not trigger shortcuts. However, the same is true if you have a check-button focused, or a slider. So, if a shortcut doesn't work, click away and try again!</p>
        <p>The following commands are available:</p>
        <keybind bind="bind" ng-repeat="bind in keybinds"></keybind>
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="File Output and Loading Results with Python">
        <h4>Output file structure</h4>
        <p>Marz saves <code>.mz</code> files as output. These files are formatted ot be ASCII, comma-separated value files. An <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Samreay/Marz/releases/download/1.0.0/alldata_SRH.mz"> example file can be found here.</a></p>
        <p>Comment lines begin with a <code>#</code>, and there should be three header lines marked as comments. The first contains details on who generated results for what file at what time. As such, it contains your initials, the filename analysed and the date the results were downloaded. The second line gives some basic statistics on the file - the number of spectra matched > QOP2, the total number of spectra, and the overall success rate. The third comment line simply contains the headers for the tabular data.</p>
        <p>The rest of the file is then comprised of one row per matched spectra, where the spectra fibre, name, right ascension, declination, magnitude and type are stated in the first six columns if they exist. The next four columns detail the results of the automatic matching algorithm, giving the automatically matched template ID, template name, redshift of match and cross correlation strength. The next four columns detail the final match (which often should be the same as the automatic match), giving the template ID, name, redshift and QOP flag. Any comments on the spectra are then placed in the final column. If heliocentric or CMB corrections are requested, they will be placed after the comment column.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Loading this file with Python</h4>
        <p>Given the popularity of Python in astrophysics, example code to read in the generated Marz output file has been supplied.</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-python">import numpy
def loadMarzResults(filepath):
    return numpy.genfromtxt(filepath, delimiter=',', skip_header=2, autostrip=True, names=True, dtype=None)</pre>
        <p>The result is a structured <code>numpy</code> array and can undergo normal array operations:</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-python">res = loadMarzResults(pathToResultsFile)
confident = res[res['QOP'] == 4]</pre>
